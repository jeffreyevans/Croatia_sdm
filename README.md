2. Download_GLASS_LAI.R - Downloads and processes Leaf Area Index from GLASS, returns trend covariate

3. process_telemetry_data.R - Creates a density-based sample of the telemetry data using an Autocorrelated Kernel Density Estimate 

4. croatia_sdm.R and croatia_telemetry_sdm.R - Species Distribution Model. The telemetry version creates a balanced subsample between telemetry and occurance data   

Other code

1. accuracy.R â€“ Modification of rfUtilities function which provides validation metrics based on confusion matrix

2. check.packages.R - Checks if required libraries are installed and adds them if not in library. Also defines library environment and mirror. Can be used to simply add required libraries to current R environmnet.
